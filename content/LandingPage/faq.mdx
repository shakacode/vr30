<summary>How much does Hawaii Chee cost to hosts?</summary>
<b>Inquiries are free for now as we have not yet started our pay-by-performance charging.</b> Even when we are charging, your first inquiry will be free. After your first inquiry, we will ask you to choose either a Pay-Per-Inquiry or Pay-Per-Booking plan, or you can choose to not list on the Hawaii Chee site. If your listings are not on our site but are on VRBO or Airbnb, they will still appear on Hawaii Chee as meta-listings with links to VRBO or Airbnb. In other words, your listing will show in searches, but without a direct to host button.

The total marketing cost of bookings on Hawaii Chee will be around 5% or 6%. That compares to an overall take-rate of 15-20% on VRBO and Airbnb. In other words, if a guest pays $1,000 total on their credit card, VRBO or Airbnb is getting around $175. For a direct booking via an inquiry from Hawaii Chee, the marketing cost would about $50. We bring your rental to market at a very attractive rate and all without getting in your way!

<summary>How much does VR30.rent cost to hosts?</summary>
VR30 will have no fees. You'll get inquiries. How will VR30 make money? VR30 will be sponsored by Sterman Realty, and Sterman's listings will show at the top of sorts. Having enough listings on the site makes it useful for travelers.

<summary>When will VR30 be showing listings? </summary>
Here's the VR30 roadmap:

1. A simple directory of all listings on the site links to fully functional listings, just like those shown on HawaiiChee.com (https://www.hawaiichee.com/users/stermanrealty).
2. Later, we'll have full search capabilities, like searching on HawaiiChee.com for Oahu: https://www.hawaiichee.com/listings/usa/hawaii/oahu
